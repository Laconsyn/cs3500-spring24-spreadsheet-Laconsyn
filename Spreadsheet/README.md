# Comments to Evaluators:

The Spreadsheet object worked properly and stands on its own. There are no bugs or deficiencies by now. 
Type of content is hardly restricted by now with three methods. May merge into a generic method in the future. 
Dependency Graph and Formula class is implemented in this class. 
Content of the cells are stored in a Hash table. 
Could throw exceptions with invalid name or content input. 
The class is written after the implementation of most test cases, using the idea of TDD. 

# Assignment Specific Topics

# Consulted Peers:

I didn't discuss about the tests. I have a relatively clear understanding on what to do.
