# Comments to Evaluators:

There are multiple tests covering different regular and edges cases for the methods in the Formula class. 
The test methods worked and stands on its own. There are no bugs or deficiencies by now. 
Most tests are implemented during the main code is written. 
The line coverage is 99.5% but every line is displayed as tested. 

# Assignment Specific Topics

# Consulted Peers:
