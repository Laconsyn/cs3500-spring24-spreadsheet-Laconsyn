# Comments to Evaluators:

There are multiple tests covering different regular and edges cases for the methods in the Dependency Graph class. 
The test methods worked and stands on its own. There are no bugs or deficiencies by now. 
Most tests are implemented before the main code is written. 
The line coverage is 100%.
