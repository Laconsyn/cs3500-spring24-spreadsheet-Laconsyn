# Comments to Evaluators:

The Evaluate method in the Evaluator worked and stands on its own. There are no bugs or deficiencies by now. 
All exceptions thrown are ArgumentException but each of them had a different text that explains its occurrence. 
Ascii code is used to determine numbers or letters so there could be issue when non ascii characters is inputted.
The evaluation uses if-else if structure which would potentially become hard to read in the future 
when more features are added.
