# Comments to Evaluators:

The Dependency Graph object worked properly and stands on its own. There are no bugs or deficiencies by now. 
There are no exception expected to be thrown. Wrong input could result in unexpected exceptions. 
The main data type is Hash table and list in c#. No extension libraries are used currently. 
The two get methods would return an empty list if given key is not found. 
The class is written after the implementation of most test cases, using the idea of TDD. 

# Assignment Specific Topics

# Consulted Peers:

I didn't discuss about the tests. I have a relatively clear understanding on what to do.
